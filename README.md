Blog Application Backend
Project Description
This project is a backend application for managing blog creation. It is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The application allows users to:

Create an account: Register and create a new user account.
Login: Authenticate and obtain a token for accessing protected routes.
View blogs: Fetch a list of all published blogs.
Add a new blog post: Create a new blog post with a title and content.
Update a blog post: Modify the content or title of an existing blog post.
Delete a blog post: Remove a blog post from the system.
Authentication is managed using tokens, which need to be included in the request headers for protected routes.

Tools Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the application.
Express.js: Framework for creating the server and handling HTTP requests.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing blog posts and user information.
Mongoose: ODM library for interacting with MongoDB.
Docker: Containerization platform to package the application.
Docker Compose: Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
GitHub Actions: CI/CD platform for automating build, test, and deployment processes.
Nginx: Web server used for serving the application.
Terraform: Infrastructure as Code tool for managing cloud resources.
Snyk: Security tool for scanning and fixing vulnerabilities in dependencies.
DigitalOcean: Cloud provider for deploying the application.
CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline is automated using GitHub Actions and includes the following stages:

Linting: Ensures code quality and adherence to standards.
Testing: Runs unit and integration tests to validate code functionality.
Building: Compiles and prepares code for deployment.
Docker Image Creation: Packages the application into a Docker image.
Docker Image Push: Uploads the Docker image to Docker Hub.
Deployment: Automatically deploys the Docker image to DigitalOcean.
